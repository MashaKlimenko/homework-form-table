        <h2>Maki Sushi</h2>
        <p>Maki sushi is a roll of fish/seafood with rice wrapped in nori (seaweed). Two maki sushi types are: Futomaki (“fat maki”) is the bigger form of maki, usually made with two or more different fillings. Hosomaki (“thin maki”) is made with only one filling, usually fish or seafood, but may also be a single vegetable or omelette. For instructions how to make it, see our full guide on: ” how to make sushi maki “.</p>

        <h2>Nigiri sushi</h2>
        <p>is a popular type of sushi shaped by hand. It is made of a slice of raw fish, seafood, tamago or other toppings lying on a “thumb sized” chunk of vinegar seasoned sushi rice, with a small amount of wasabi in between. Wanna make your own Nigiri? See our full guide here: ”</p>

        <h2>Inside out sushi</h2>
        <p>Inside out sushi (or Uramaki ) is similar to “maki sushi”, except that the rice is on the outside of the nori, and it is usually prepared with more than two fillings – for example salmon, cucumber and, what seems to be a slice of pineapple. It is sometimes topped with a thin slice of fish, seafood or vegetable like avocado or sweet potato. For instructions how to make it, see our full guide on: ” how to make inside out sushi maki ”</p>
